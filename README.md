Download the files into a folder. 
Cd to that folder, run "npm install" (this will install a file named package-lock.json and a folder named node_modules). 
Run npm start to run the development version.

You can package the code into a desktop application by running the command "npm package-mac" for Mac OSX, "npm package-win" for Windows, and "npm package-linux" for Linux. 

Please be cautious as this was built around 4 years ago so many of the dependencies are probably on outdated versions and the packaging may not work. 

When you first open the application you will be prompted with a login page:

Input the text "test" then press the enter button to login.

You will then be taken to the tasks page. To create a task press the create button and input your desired info for checking out a product:

I will not be going over a tutorial on how to use the application as the app is incompleted and not meant to be used. It is mearly a demonstration of the coding ability I had 4 years ago (at the time of writing this July 9, 2022).
