Download the files into a folder. Then cd to that folder, run "npm install" (this will install a file named package-lock.json and a folder named node_modules). Then run npm start to run the development version.
You can package the code into a desktop application by running the command "npm package-mac" for Mac OSX, "npm package-win" for Windows, and "npm package-linux" for Linux. Please be cautious as this was built around 4 years ago so many of the dependencies are probably on outdated versions and the packaging may not work.
